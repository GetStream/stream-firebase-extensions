# Create Activity Feeds with Stream Feeds

**Author**: Stream (**[https://getstream.io/](https://getstream.io/)**)

**Description**: Syncs a Firestore collection with Stream Feeds to add real-time engagement to your application.

**Details**: Use this extension to automatically create Activity Feeds from data in a Firestore collection.

The extension listens for Firestore write events and synchronizes corresponding activities in Streamâ€™s Activity Feeds. The Firestore documents are expected to be stored with the following path, where `feeds` is customizable via the `COLLECTION` parameter:

```http
feeds/{feedId}/{userId}/{foreignId}
```

The stored documents must have at least the following fields:

- `actor`: the entity performing the activity
- `verb`: the type of action performed on the activity
- `object`: he content of the activity itself (often a reference)

For more details, see the [Stream Activity Feeds documentation](https://getstream.io/activity-feeds/docs/node/adding_activities).
