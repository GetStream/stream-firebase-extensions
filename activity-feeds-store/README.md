**Author**: Stream (**[https://getstream.io/](https://getstream.io/)**)

**Description**: Automatically populate Stream Activity feeds data from a Firestore.

**Details**: Use this extension to automatically create activity feeds from data in a Firestore Collection.

This extension listens for Firestore write events and synchronizes corresponding activities in Stream Activity Feeds. The Firestore documents are expected to be stored with the following path, where `feeds` is customizable via the `COLLECTION` parameter:

```http
feeds/{feedId}/{userId}/{foreignId}
```

The stored documents must have at least to follow fields:

- `actor`: the actor performing the activity
- `verb`: the verb of the activity
- `object`: the object of the activity

For more details, see the [Stream Activity Feeds documentation](https://getstream.io/activity-feeds/docs/node/adding_activities).
