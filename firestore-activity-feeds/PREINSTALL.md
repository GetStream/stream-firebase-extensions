Use this extension to automatically create Activity Feeds from data in a Firestore collection.

The extension listens for Firestore write events and synchronizes corresponding activities in Streamâ€™s Activity Feeds. The Firestore documents are expected to be stored with the following path, where `feeds` is customizable via the `COLLECTION` parameter:

```bash
feeds/{feedId}/{userId}/{foreignId}
```

The stored documents must have at least the following fields:

- `actor`: the entity performing the activity
- `verb`: the type of action performed on the activity
- `object`: the content of the activity itself (often a reference)

For more details, see the [Stream Activity Feeds documentation](https://getstream.io/activity-feeds/docs/node/adding_activities).
